At the top of of the output of git status, you can see the following text: On branch main. Branches allow separating some commits from others. This means that a new branch can be developed independently from an old branch. It is customary for projects to have a main branch, usually called literally main or alternatively master, containing the version currently in use.

Traditionally git has used the term master to refer to the main or default branch. During years 2020 and 2021 many platforms, such as GitHub and Gitlab, transitioned into using main as the default name for this branch. Git itself followed suit in 2021 and recent versions of git create a branch named main by default.

Branches are usually used for testing out new features without breaking a working version of the program. Since branches donâ€™t affect each other states, the new branch can be played with without worrying about other ones. When the changes made to the new branch are deemed ready, the branch can be merged to the main branch, and thus the new features will be published. For now it suffices to understand that we will only use the main branch in the exercises.
